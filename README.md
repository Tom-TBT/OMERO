# OMERO

### Convenience Functions:
Collection of functions related to the OMERO Image database for easy integration in Python scripts.

Code was adapted from the offical OMERO guide (https://omero-guides.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/docs/gettingstarted.html), OMERO Python language bindings documentation (https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.6.0/developers/Python.htm) and the ilastik API - OMERO tutorial (https://omero-guides.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ilastik/docs/gettingstarted.html).  




# N2V

Interactive GUI to train and apply the DeepLearningTool Noise2Void for image denoising. 

The GUI implements the original N2V code by Krull et al., Noise2Void - Learning Denoising from Single Noisy Images (https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10980)
Source code: https://github.com/juglab/N2V_fiji/
